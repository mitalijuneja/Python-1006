Homework 2 part B

1. completed the functions in projectile.py. Also, completed the extra task of using lists to modify the s_sim function. I left in my original s_sim function and implemented the modification in a function called s_sim_lst and called this function from the tester (modified the tester to show this call and comment out the original s_sim call)

2. completed the utility functions in util.py and data.py
